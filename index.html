  <h1>▌ Personal information</h1>
  <p>My name is Yahui Qin , my student number is 3730980, and the student email address is s3730980@student.rmit.edu.au. I am from China and I am 21 years old. I finished high school in China and then came to Australia. For the past two decades, I have always used Mandarin to communicate with people, but I have been learning English since I was a child and I also like foreign education methods, so I decided to study abroad. In my free time, I like to play games. My favorite game is League of Legends. This game is very competitive and the feeling of winning allows me to relax the most. I can communicate and cooperate with my teammates while playing the game, which is also what excites me.</p>
  <p>Regarding IT, I have always found programming and production software extremely attractive, and I have also developed some interest in artificial intelligence and network security. From the beginning of junior high school, I found that computer knowledge attracted my attention. In my young age, work related to information technology is particularly cool, so I started to learn some simple programming knowledge. I still remember playing a game called ‘Lightbot’.This game allows users to learn simple programming logic while having the fun of the game, which is extremely aroused my interest in programming. We have classes and exchanges together, and we also participated in a robot competition together. In that competition, our team worked together to write simple codes for the robots to control movement and complete the actions required by the task. Through that experience, I completely fell in love with the IT major and knew that I would definitely choose to work in this industry in the future.</p>
  <p>Before I applied to the university, my teachers and parents told me that RMIT is an excellent school, so I looked up many school-related information on the school's official website. The computer major of RMIT is relatively well-known throughout the world. RMIT has a large number of professional teachers, so the quality of teaching has a great guarantee. Most of the courses in school are taught in small classes, which can encourage students to actively participate in the classroom and better absorb knowledge. I think this kind of learning environment is quite suitable for me.In addition to high-quality course teaching, RMIT pays attention to students' graduation issues. The content of the courses are highly practical and creative, which can ensure that students have enough professional abilities when they graduate, so as to get a great job.</p>
  <p>I look forward to learn technology about programming,security and cloud computing, web computing, artificial intelligence, data management and software development.The world is gradually moving towards digitization, and these aspects are necessary for a computer major student.</p>
