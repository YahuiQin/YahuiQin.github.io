  <h1>▌ Project Idea</h1>
  
  <h2>☛ Overview</h2>
  <p>My project idea is to create a completely smart home control system. This system can integrate all electrical appliances in the house through the Internet of Things technology, allowing users to control the home through speech and behavior.In my vision, the main operation mode of the system should be based on the user's behavior, by capturing the user's actions to achieve the user's purpose, and at the same time supplemented by voice control to replacing the original personal operation method and the latest mobile phone control system.The project uses advanced technologies such as network communication technology, automatic control technology, audio and video technology to integrate and control the facilities related to home life, build efficient residential facilities.</p>

  <h2>☛ Motivation</h2>
  <p>The pace of society is accelerating, people are getting busy and the number of things to be handled at the same time is suddenly increasing. The participation of smart homes in life can greatly enhance people's happiness in life. In order to let people enjoy life better, engineers came up with multi-scene linkage, combining home appliances, security, and door control into a smart home. In addition, simplification of operation is the development trend that people expect. Adding image recognition to the smart home system can reduce the operations required by users. Users do not need to learn how to use control software. Only simple actions and languages can help them achieve the purpose of controlling the home and simplify the operation steps. This can bring users a safer, more efficient and comfortable smart life, leading the trend of modern smart homes.</p>

  <h2>☛ Description</h2>
  <p>The project consists of three parts: language recognition function, image recognition function and central processing unit. In order to achieve the purpose of controlling all households, a central microprocessor receives the information from the sensors, and then sends appropriate information to other electronic and electrical products in a predetermined procedure. First, a pair of glasses with simple functions will be designed to satisfy the image recognition function. This pair of glasses contains cameras, sensors, and storage and transmission equipment. When the user uses the glasses for the first time, the system requires the user to use the camera on the lens to take pictures of all the homes. After the camera enters the picture data of the furniture, it will be stored in the storage transmission module and uploaded to the central control system. For example, when the user chooses "enter curtain information", the user puts on the glasses and stands in front of the curtain to take photos from various angles. The final data will be transmitted to the central processing unit. When the user needs to open the curtain, the control system allows the user to sit on the sofa and look at the curtain with glasses. The glasses successfully capture the curtain information and send data to the central processing unit. After the recognition is successful, the user speaks a simple password ‘open’ to open the curtain. This function can effectively reduce the user's operation and create a fast and convenient life. On the other hand, the voice recognition system is a function to assist in image recognition. When the user speaks the command ‘on’ or ‘off’ to the speaker, the vocabulary content in the voice is converted into computer-readable input and data is sent to the central microprocessor. After the glasses first send a successful identification message to the system, the smart speaker can collect the next instructions from the user. In addition, smart speakers can also collect user commands such as "open curtains" separately. This operation allows users to have alternative solutions to open it when they are not looking at the furniture.The user can turn on the air conditioner in the living room in the room, but this means that the user needs to speak longer instructions.The central control system is composed of remote control equipment, central control host and various control ports. The host will be connected to a screen inlaid on the wall to intuitively show the various modules of the furniture to the user. When the control system receives the information from the sensor, it analyzes and processes the information, and then completes the instructions through the control program.When the instruction is completed, the icon of that household module on the screen will change to remind the user that the operation is successful. At the same time, the screen also allows the user to control each module by touch. After clicking into a furniture module, the user can choose ‘on’ or ‘off’ to control the furniture.</p>

  <h2>☛ Tools and Tech</h2>
  <p>The hardware required for this project includes micro cameras, infrared sensors, smart switches, smart speakers, smart glasses, lighting equipment, smart door locks, electric curtains, bathroom toilets, kitchen appliances and terminal controllers. The required software is central control software. The existing open source smart homes have ‘homeassistant’.</p>
   <hr>
  <h2>☛ Skills Required</h2>
  <p>The required skills are electronic technology, communication technology, graphic design technology, radio technology, image recognition technology and integrated wiring technology.In order to realize this project, the hardware knowledge that needs to be learned is circuit board chip-level development. The software needs to learn the underlying language and know how to program the control software with java. In the next three years of study, I will learn most of the software knowledge and master most of the technologies. The knowledge of hardware requires elective courses or learning in the process of work after graduation.</p>
   <hr>
  <h2>☛ Outcome</h2>
  <p>If the project is successful, Through this intelligent system, the user can achieve the purpose of controlling the furniture through the simplest and fastest operation. This can effectively reduce users' unnecessary operations in normal life, such as walking to the door to turn on the lights.The realization of smart homes has changed the one-to-one mechanical switch mode of traditional homes, and raised family life to a kind of system management. Its control methods are not only diversified and more humanized, but also allow people to obtain a higher sense of happiness. This project will eventually lead to the popularization of smart homes in every family and increase the convenience that high technology brings to people.</p>
